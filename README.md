# Moneytor_test
  This is a test given for Moneytor
  
1.Power of a number: 
  Here we had taken two inputs 'a' and 'b' for calculating the value of a^b we had usen recursion concept 

2.Removing duplicates from an array:
  At first we had the number of input from the user and we had used (not in) concept in python and removes the duplicates from the given array.
  we have usen the for loop for 'n' times and a if condition to check the given input in the list or not. So it changes logaritmly so it gives the time complexity O(nlogn)
  
3.Fibonacci series:
  we had taken an integer n and prints the fibonacci series upto the integer n using the while loop.
